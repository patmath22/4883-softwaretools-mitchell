# Assignment 05 Family Tree
### Patrick Mitchell
### Description:

In this assignment we were tasked to create a family tree. We used python to generate the code for
GraphVix. Then use GraphViz to produce the .svg file. First we created a smaller .json file to text out
the FamTree.py code, after we got it working we replaced the json file with dwarf.json which was taken from

Dr. Griffins GitHub repository. 

### Files

|   #   | File            | Description                                        |
| :---: | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
|   1   | [FamTree.py](FamTree.py)        | Python code that generates GraphViz code     |
|   2   | [family_tree.dot](family_tree.dot)   | Code generated by FamTree.py      |
|   3  | [famTree.svg](famTree.svg) | Graph produced by GraphViz |
| 4 | [dwarf.json](dwarf.json)  | The json file that contains the data used in 1 |

### Instructions

The file dwarf.json is a dictionary file with several keywords. One in particular, the generation key, is used in the FamTree.py to
create subgraphs. Hence you will need to know the range of your allowable generations. Make sure the file dwarf.json is included in the directory in which you are running FamTree.py

## Imported

The python code uses:

1. import graphviz 
2. import json
