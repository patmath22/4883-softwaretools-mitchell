# Assignment 05 Family Tree
### Patrick Mitchell
### Description:

In this assignment we were tasked to create a family tree. We used python to generate the code for
GraphVix. Then use GraphViz to produce the .svg file. First we created a smaller .json file to text out
the FamTree.py code, after we got it working we replaced the json file with dwarf.json which was taken from
Dr. Griffins GitHub repository.
