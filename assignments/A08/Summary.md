# Brief Summary for Assignment 08
### Patrick Mitchell

In this assignment we created a RESTful API using FastAPI that provides access to COVID-19 data.
 The API will fetch the data from a publicly available data source and expose endpoints to retrieve various statistics related to COVID-19 cases.

 We created the assigned aggregate routes, with the exception of /avg_deaths. For this we instead created a mortality rate for a given country. The mortality rate is defined as the number of deaths divided by the number of cases. We also created a route that gives to mortality rate of a country during a particular time frame.

 After completeing this project, as usual, I would make some changes in the coding. Several of the functions basically did the samething with small minor changes. Writing more robost functions would definitely make the coding more efficient and readable.
