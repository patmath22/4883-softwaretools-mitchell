### History

LaTeX is a markup language. It is essentially an upgrade of Donald Knuth's landmark typesetting language called TeX.

Leslie Lamport created a package of additional commands to simplify and expand the abilities of TeX, this grew into what we now know as LaTex. 

A number of community-supported TeX distributions are available,
including TeX Live (multiplatform), teTeX (deprecated in favor of TeXLive, UNIX), MiKTeX (Windows),
MacTeX (TeX Live with the addition of Mac specific programs).
